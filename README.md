## Git Basics

1. In working with Git, everything is new for me, but everything is very interesting.
1. I was surprised that Git is not as difficult as it seemed at first glance. But practice is needed to assimilate the acquired knowledge.
1. Without a doubt, I will use this knowledge for further study and work

## Git Collaboration

1. I took the course "Introduction to Git and GitHub" on Coursera. It was interesting but a bit difficult to understand. More practice is needed.
1. I was surprised that conflicts are not as difficult to resolve as I thought.
1. Undoubtedly, the knowledge I received will be useful in further studies
