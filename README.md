## Git Basics

1. I completed two weeks of the "Introduction to Git and GitHub" course on Coursera. It was very educational for me. Before that, I worked very little with git
1. I went through levels like Introduction Sequence, Ramping Up and Push & Pull. This helped to better assimilate the knowledge obtained on Coursera
1. Without a doubt, I will use this knowledge for further study and work

1. I went through levels like Moving Work Around, To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes! It helped to better assimilate the knowledge gained on Coursera.
1. Undoubtedly, the knowledge I received will be useful in further studies
