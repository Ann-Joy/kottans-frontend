## Git Basics

1. In working with Git, everything is new for me, but everything is very interesting.
1. I was surprised that Git is not as difficult as it seemed at first glance. But practice is needed to assimilate the acquired knowledge.
1. Without a doubt, I will use this knowledge for further study and work

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. I have never worked with the Linux operating system. Therefore, all the knowledge gained after passing Linux Survival was new to me. I also read two articles about HTTP. I only had a general understanding of HTTP, so it was a lot of new and difficult things for me to understand.
1. I was surprised how much can be done through the command line, it's very interesting.
1. I have already installed a Linux operating system to practice the acquired knowledge.

## Git Collaboration

1. I took the course "Introduction to Git and GitHub" on Coursera. It was interesting but a bit difficult to understand. More practice is needed.
1. I was surprised that conflicts are not as difficult to resolve as I thought.
1. Undoubtedly, the knowledge I received will be useful in further studies
